I'm a data world enthusiast. Since I discovered this area in 2020, I search for new knowledge to become a data scientist. I‚Äôm passionate about how to transform data into useful information and what they can tell us. 

Today I'm working as a Data Analyst at Globo, the biggest Media Tech in Brazil, helping the technology support teams guarantee better delivery to our public as BBB reality shows or the coverage of the Olympic games. 

 Every day I work to understand the data and demands that our internal clients needs, solve problems and make how they can see their numbers and information in a better way to make better decisions in a day to day, through BI solutions in Data Studio, BigQuery and ServiceNow platforms. 

I love my family, my soccer team, technology, be with friends, know new places, and I do a social job as a catholic missionary!

**Background in:** Python, SQL, Data Viz, Bigquery, GCP, Data Studio, Power BI
